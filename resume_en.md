Summary
-------

*   **Software Architect and Developer** with a track record of building
    systems that allows people to focus on their areas of expertise.


Skills
------

*   Experience with the design and development of desktop, client-server,
    mobile and scientific software applications. Most recent projects were
    mostly **Python** and **JavaScript**, but languages used proficiently
    in the past include **C, Objective-C, Java** and **Fortran**.

    Worked with several development platforms/libraries (such as **Cocoa**,
    **Maemo**, and **Cray supercomputers**), tools and frameworks (e.g.
    **Flask** and **Django**) working on **Linux**, **Mac OS X**
    and also **iOS**.

    Strong knowledge of **scientific programming**, web technologies
    (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc.), algorithms, data structures and other
    concepts and paradigms relevant to software development.


Education
---------

*   **B.E. Computer Engineering**

    Universidade Federal de São Carlos (UFSCar), 2004-2010

*   **Technical High School in Informatics**

    Sociedade Educacional Três de Maio (SETREM), 2000-2003


Professional History
--------------------

*   Since September 2013 I'm working in the Sync API team at
    [**Titans Group**][22]. Sync is a whitelabel product for files and
    contacts synchronization and base to Titans' [**Personal Cloud**][23].
    In the API team we develop the backend used by all our clients (Web, iOS,
    Android, Windows, OS X) and the Web client, the reference implementation.

    From December 2010 to April 2013 I worked at the Brazilian
    [**National Institute for Space Research**][1],
    developing tools for a coupled general circulation model. This includes:

    -  [**Bosun**][2], a runtime environment. It is used to **document** and
    **automate** the tasks related to running a **climate model**
    (prepare inputs, compile the code, run the model, archive the results).
    It is based on [**Fabric**][3] and can be used as a library or CLI.

    -  [**Thalassa**][4], an ocean grid editing application.

    -  Setting up a **Jenkins** server to do **continuous integration**
    of the codebase.

    -  Maintaining an [**EasyBuild**][20] installation.

    -  Help with the data analysis, using the **SciPy** stack and other
    softwares like **Ferret** and **GrADS**.

    -  Operationalization of the model for **seasonal climate forecasts**.

    -  Python training for researchers, including setting up **IPython
    notebooks** and **parallel clusters** on the supercomputer.

    From September 2008 to July 2009 I worked at [**Pinuts Studios**][5],
    a mobile development company. At first I worked on a prototype for a
    **Maemo** application, and after that in their first **iOS app**.

    Between 2006 and 2007 I worked at [**Embrapa Instrumentação
    Agropecuária**][21] developing a [**video tracking application for
    statistical analysis of animal behavior**][6].
    More specifically, the research was done to study the effects of
    pheromone traps on insects, which would avoid the use of chemical
    pesticides and their impact on nature.
    It was implemented in **Python**, using **GStreamer** for video
    manipulation and **PyGTK** for UI.


Open-Source Projects and Other Activities
-----------------------------------------

*   During the 30 hours of the first OLPC Game Jam Brasil, in 2007, I
    co-developed a game called [**Gambiarra**][7] (it means 'Workaround'
    in portuguese). It was written in **Python**, using **PyGame**.

    Since 2012  I''m developing with [Arnaldo Russo][8] a **sonification**
    tool for scientific data called [**OceanSound**][9].
    We presented it as a poster during the **Brazilian Oceanographic
    Conference**. Our session in the conference caught the attention of many
    participants, which praised our work and contributed with new
    approaches and data to analyze.
    An updated version was presented at [**PyCon 2013**][10]
    and there is a [**live demo**][11] available.

    Spoke in conferences like **FISL** and **PythonBrasil**, and also in
    events at universities such as **UFSCar** and **Uniara**. Topics included
    **image processing**, **game development**, **HPC** and
    **software engineering**.

    Non-development activities includes adapting Monty Python sketches
    to Portuguese and presenting them in **PythonBrasil** as
    lightning talks, including a
    [sketch about programming languages based on the Spanish Inquisition][12].
    Besides acting, I made a short movie called [Salad][13] and I also
    [play guitar][14]. Usually my partner in crime in these art attempts is
    [Gabriel Marcondes][15].

Certifications and Awards
-------------------------

-   [**Winner**][16] of the [Pinboard Investment Co-Prosperity Cloud][17] (2013)

-   **Instructor** at the [São Paulo Summer School on Global Climate Modeling][18] (2011)

-   **Bronze medal** at the [Brazilian Olympiad in Informatics][19] (2004)


Languages
---------

*   I am a Portuguese native speaker with **fluency in English**, with very
    brief contacts with German and Spanish in the past.
